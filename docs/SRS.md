- *Acceptance Criteria:*
  - Users can log in with valid credentials
  - Invalid login attempts are limited and logged

**FR-002**: The system shall assign roles to users with specific permissions.
- *Inputs:* User role assignment data
- *Processing:* Assign permissions based on role definitions
- *Outputs:* User role and permission set
- *Acceptance Criteria:*
  - Roles can be created, modified, and assigned
  - Permissions restrict access appropriately

### 3.2 SF-002: Data Security and Backup

**Description:** Ensure data is stored securely with regular backups and recovery options.
**Priority:** high

**Functional Requirements:**

**FR-003**: All sensitive data shall be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- *Inputs:* User data, system data
- *Processing:* Apply encryption protocols (e.g., TLS, AES)
- *Outputs:* Encrypted data storage and transmission
- *Acceptance Criteria:*
  - Encryption standards comply with industry best practices
  - Data breaches are mitigated

**FR-004**: The system shall perform daily backups and support data recovery.
- *Inputs:* Backup schedule and data snapshots
- *Processing:* Automate backup process, store backups securely
- *Outputs:* Restored data upon request
- *Acceptance Criteria:*
  - Backups are completed successfully daily
  - Data can be restored within acceptable timeframes

### 3.3 SF-003: Workflow Management

**Description:** Support aerospace-specific workflows for project management and task tracking.
**Priority:** medium

**Functional Requirements:**

**FR-005**: Users shall be able to create, assign, and track tasks within projects.
- *Inputs:* Task details, user assignments
