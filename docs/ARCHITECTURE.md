## Executive Summary

This architecture provides a secure, scalable, and maintainable platform hosted on AWS, supporting project management, infrastructure provisioning, and reporting functionalities tailored for aerospace & defense industry needs. It emphasizes modularity, security compliance, and future scalability.

### Key Decisions
- Adopt a microservices architecture for flexibility and scalability
- Use AWS as the cloud provider for its compliance standards and extensive service offerings

### Technology Highlights
- React.js for frontend for rich, responsive UI
- FastAPI (Python) for backend APIs due to rapid development and security features
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage with strong compliance support
- Redis for caching to improve performance
- Terraform for infrastructure as code to ensure repeatability
- Kubernetes (EKS) for container orchestration

## System Architecture

**Architecture Style:** microservices

### Architecture Overview

The system comprises a React.js frontend communicating via REST APIs with a FastAPI backend, which interacts with PostgreSQL for persistent storage, Redis for caching, and AWS services for deployment. Kubernetes manages container orchestration, with CI/CD pipelines automating deployment and monitoring tools overseeing system health.

### System Components

#### Frontend Web Application

**Purpose:** User interface for project management, reporting, and system interaction

**Responsibilities:**
- Render UI
- Handle user input
- Communicate with backend APIs

**Technologies:** React.js, Axios for API calls

#### Backend API Service

**Purpose:** Business logic, data processing, and API endpoints

**Responsibilities:**
- Process client requests
- Authenticate users
- Manage project data

**Technologies:** FastAPI, Python

#### Database

**Purpose:** Store project data, user info, and system configurations

**Responsibilities:**
- Data persistence
- Data integrity

**Technologies:** PostgreSQL

#### Cache Layer

**Purpose:** Improve system responsiveness and reduce database load

**Responsibilities:**
- Cache frequently accessed data

**Technologies:** Redis

#### Infrastructure & Orchestration

**Purpose:** Provision, manage, and scale infrastructure

**Responsibilities:**
- Automate deployment
- Ensure high availability

**Technologies:** Terraform, AWS EKS (Kubernetes)

### Data Flow

#### User Interaction

User interacts with React frontend, which sends requests to FastAPI backend

1. User submits request via UI
2. Frontend calls REST API
3. Backend processes request, interacts with database/cache as needed
4. Response sent back to frontend
5. UI updates accordingly

#### Deployment & Infrastructure

CI/CD pipelines automate deployment to AWS EKS, with infrastructure managed via Terraform

1. Code committed to repository
2. CI/CD triggers build and tests
3. Terraform applies infrastructure changes
4. Containers are deployed to EKS
5. System is monitored and scaled automatically

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

**Framework:** React.js

*Justification:* Popular, flexible, supports rich UI, large community, suitable for enterprise dashboards

**Libraries:**

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Axios | HTTP requests |
| Material-UI | UI components |

### Backend

**Framework:** FastAPI
**Language:** Python

*Justification:* Fast, secure, easy to develop REST APIs, supports async operations, good for rapid prototyping

**Libraries:**

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| SQLAlchemy | ORM for PostgreSQL |
| Pydantic | Data validation |

### Database

**Primary Database:** PostgreSQL
*Justification:* Strong compliance support, relational integrity, scalability options

**Caching:** Redis
*Justification:* High performance caching layer to reduce latency and database load

### Infrastructure

**Cloud Provider:** AWS
**Hosting:** EKS (Kubernetes managed service)
**CDN:** CloudFront for static assets
**Storage:** S3 for static files and backups

### DevOps

**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
**Containerization:** Docker
**Orchestration:** Kubernetes (EKS)

**Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus/Grafana

**Logging:** ELK Stack

### Third-Party Integrations

| Service | Purpose | API Type |
|---------|---------|----------|
| AWS APIs | Hosting, security, and resource management | - |

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

**Method:** OAuth2
**Provider:** Custom or AWS Cognito

### Authorization

**Model:** RBAC
**Implementation:** Role-based access control enforced via API gateway and backend logic

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest with AWS KMS-managed keys
- Encryption in transit via HTTPS/SSL
- Data masking for sensitive info

**Compliance:** Industry-specific aerospace & defense standards, GDPR (if applicable)

### Security Measures
- Regular security audits
- Secure coding practices
- Network segmentation and VPC isolation

## Scalability & Reliability

**Scaling Strategy:** Auto-scaling based on CPU and request load
**Load Balancing:** AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)

### High Availability

**Approach:** Multi-AZ deployments for database and services
**Failover:** Automatic failover with AWS RDS Multi-AZ and Kubernetes readiness probes

### Disaster Recovery
