## Executive Summary

The proposed architecture for Solis is a scalable, secure, and maintainable web-based platform leveraging cloud infrastructure. It adopts a microservices style to ensure flexibility, scalability, and isolated security boundaries, supporting aerospace-specific workflows with role-based access and data security.

### Key Decisions
- Use cloud-native services (AWS) for scalability and security
- Implement microservices architecture for modularity and scalability
- Choose React for frontend for responsiveness and developer productivity
- Use Python with FastAPI for backend APIs for performance and rapid development

### Technology Highlights
- React.js for frontend UI
- FastAPI (Python) for backend API services
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- AWS cloud services (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront)
- OAuth2 with JWT for authentication
- Kubernetes for container orchestration

## System Architecture

**Architecture Style:** microservices

### Architecture Overview

The system comprises a frontend web application communicating via RESTful APIs with multiple backend microservices hosted on Kubernetes clusters. Data is stored in PostgreSQL, with Redis used for caching and session management. External integrations occur via secure REST APIs, and the system is deployed on AWS cloud infrastructure with CDN and storage services.

### System Components

#### Frontend Web Application

**Purpose:** Provide user interface for end-users and administrators

**Responsibilities:**
- Render UI
- Handle user interactions
- Communicate with backend APIs

**Technologies:** React.js, TypeScript, Redux

#### Authentication Service

**Purpose:** Manage user login, MFA, and token issuance

**Responsibilities:**
- Authenticate users
- Issue JWT tokens
- Support MFA

**Technologies:** OAuth2, JWT, FastAPI

#### User Management & Authorization Service

**Purpose:** Manage roles, permissions, and user profiles

**Responsibilities:**
- Assign roles
- Enforce access control

**Technologies:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL

#### Workflow & Project Management Service

**Purpose:** Handle task creation, updates, and project workflows

**Responsibilities:**
- Create/update tasks
- Track progress
- Notify users

**Technologies:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL

#### Data Security & Backup Module

**Purpose:** Encrypt data, perform backups, and support recovery

**Responsibilities:**
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Automate backups
- Restore data as needed

**Technologies:** TLS, AES encryption, AWS RDS automated backups

### Data Flow

#### User Authentication

User submits credentials via frontend, which calls Authentication Service; upon success, JWT token is issued and stored in client.

1. User enters credentials
2. Frontend sends request to Auth Service
3. Auth Service verifies credentials
4. JWT token issued and returned to frontend
5. Frontend stores token and uses it for subsequent requests

#### Task Management

Users create/update tasks via frontend, which calls Workflow Service; data stored in PostgreSQL, with cache updates in Redis.

1. User creates/updates task
2. Frontend sends request with JWT token
3. Workflow Service processes request
4. Data stored in PostgreSQL
5. Cache invalidated/updated in Redis

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

**Framework:** React.js

*Justification:* Popular, flexible, supports responsive design, large community, and rapid development.

**Libraries:**

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Redux | State management |
| Material-UI | UI components |

### Backend

**Framework:** FastAPI
**Language:** Python

*Justification:* High performance, asynchronous support, easy to develop REST APIs, and aligns with security and rapid iteration needs.

**Libraries:**

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| PyJWT | JWT token handling |
| SQLAlchemy | ORM for PostgreSQL |

### Database

**Primary Database:** PostgreSQL
*Justification:* Robust relational database, supports complex queries, ACID compliance, industry standard.

**Caching:** Redis
*Justification:* Fast in-memory data store, supports session management and caching to improve performance.

**Search:** Elasticsearch
*Justification:* Optional, for advanced search capabilities if needed in future phases.

### Infrastructure

**Cloud Provider:** AWS
**Hosting:** EKS (Kubernetes managed service)
**CDN:** CloudFront
**Storage:** S3

### DevOps

**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
**Containerization:** Docker
**Orchestration:** Kubernetes (EKS)

**Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus/Grafana

**Logging:** ELK Stack

### Third-Party Integrations

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

**Method:** OAuth2 with JWT
**Provider:** AWS Cognito or Auth0

### Authorization

**Model:** RBAC
**Implementation:** Role-based permissions enforced via middleware and database checks

### Data Protection
