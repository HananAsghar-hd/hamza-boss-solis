## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Production-ready code - protected, requires 2 approvals, all tests must pass |
| `develop` | Development integration branch - protected, requires 1 approval |
| `feature/*` | Feature branches - created from develop (e.g., feature/user-authentication) |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fix branches - created from develop (e.g., bugfix/login-validation) |
| `hotfix/*` | Production hotfixes - created from main, merged to both main and develop |
| `release/*` | Release preparation branches - created from develop (e.g., release/v1.2.0) |
| `docs/*` | Documentation updates - can be created from develop |

### Commit Conventions

**Format:** `type(scope): message`

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build, security

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): implement JWT token refresh mechanism
fix(documents): resolve version control conflict on concurrent edits
docs(api): update authentication endpoint documentation
refactor(projects): extract workflow logic into separate service
test(resources): add unit tests for capacity calculation
security(auth): implement rate limiting on login endpoint
perf(reports): optimize database queries for analytics dashboard
ci(github): add automated security scanning workflow
```

### Pull Request Process

1. 1. Create feature branch from develop: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name develop
2. 2. Make changes following coding standards and write tests
3. 3. Commit changes with conventional commit messages
4. 4. Push branch: git push origin feature/your-feature-name
5. 5. Create pull request on GitHub with detailed description
6. 6. Fill out PR template checklist (tests, documentation, security considerations)
7. 7. Request review from at least one backend and one frontend developer (if full-stack change)
8. 8. Address review comments and push updates
9. 9. Ensure all CI checks pass (tests, linting, security scans)
10. 10. Obtain required approvals (2 for main, 1 for develop)
11. 11. Squash and merge after approval
12. 12. Delete feature branch after merge

### Code Review Guidelines

- Review within 24 hours during business days
- Check for security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- Verify compliance with aerospace/defense data handling requirements
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Check for performance implications (N+1 queries, unnecessary API calls)
- Verify tests are included and provide adequate coverage
- Ensure documentation is updated (API docs, README, inline comments)
- Check for proper type hints (Python) and TypeScript types
- Verify accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) for frontend changes
- Ensure environment variables are used for configuration (no hardcoded secrets)
- Check for proper database migrations and rollback capability
- Verify API versioning and backward compatibility

## Coding Standards

### Style Guide

Backend: PEP 8 for Python, enforced by Black formatter and Flake8 linter. Frontend: Airbnb TypeScript style guide, enforced by ESLint and Prettier. Use meaningful variable names, write self-documenting code, and add comments for complex business logic.

### Linting

Backend: Black (formatter), Flake8 (linter), isort (import sorting), mypy (type checking). Frontend: ESLint with TypeScript plugin, Prettier (formatter), stylelint (CSS linting). Run 'make lint' before committing. Pre-commit hooks are configured to run linters automatically.

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:** Required for all new functions, models, serializers, and components. Use pytest for backend, Jest/React Testing Library for frontend.
- **Integration Tests:** Required for all API endpoints. Test authentication, authorization, and business logic flows.
- **Coverage Minimum:** 80% overall, 90% for critical modules (authentication, document management, compliance tracking)

### Documentation Requirements

- Python: Docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules following Google style
- TypeScript: JSDoc comments for complex functions and exported utilities
- API: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints with request/response examples
- README: Update README.md when adding new features or changing setup process
- Architecture: Document significant architectural decisions in docs/adr/
- Security: Document security considerations for sensitive features
- Inline comments: Explain 'why' not 'what' - focus on business logic and non-obvious decisions

## Architecture Overview

Three-tier architecture: React TypeScript frontend (SPA) communicates with Django REST Framework backend via RESTful APIs. Backend uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage, Redis for caching and Celery message broker. Celery workers handle asynchronous tasks (report generation, email notifications, document processing). Django Channels provides WebSocket support for real-time notifications. All components are containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS ECS Fargate behind Application Load Balancer. Static assets served via CloudFront CDN, user uploads stored in S3.

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Frontend (React + TypeScript) | Single-page application with Material-UI components, React Query for data fetching, React Router for navigation, Socket.IO for real-time updates |
| Backend API (Django REST Framework) | RESTful API with JWT authentication, role-based access control, object-level permissions via django-guardian, API versioning |
| Database (PostgreSQL 15) | Primary data store on AWS RDS with Multi-AZ deployment, automated backups, full-text search capability |
| Cache Layer (Redis 7) | AWS ElastiCache for session storage, API response caching, Celery message broker |
| Task Queue (Celery) | Asynchronous task processing for reports, emails, document processing, scheduled jobs |
| WebSocket Server (Django Channels) | Real-time notifications and updates using WebSocket protocol |
| File Storage (AWS S3) | Secure document storage with versioning, encryption at rest, lifecycle policies |
| CDN (CloudFront) | Content delivery network for static assets and frontend application |
| Load Balancer (ALB) | Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution and SSL termination |
| Container Orchestration (ECS Fargate) | Serverless container management for backend services |

### Important Patterns

- Repository Pattern: Data access logic abstracted into repository classes for testability
- Service Layer: Business logic separated from views/serializers into service classes
- Factory Pattern: Object creation using factory_boy for tests and fixtures
- Observer Pattern: Django signals for decoupled event handling (e.g., user creation triggers email)
- Strategy Pattern: Different authentication strategies (JWT, session) based on client type
- Decorator Pattern: Custom decorators for permission checks and logging
- Singleton Pattern: Database connections and cache clients
- API Versioning: URL-based versioning (/api/v1/) for backward compatibility
- Optimistic Locking: Version fields on documents to prevent concurrent edit conflicts
- Circuit Breaker: Graceful degradation when external services (S3, SES) are unavailable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port 8000 already in use**

Solution: Kill existing Django process: lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9, or change port in .env: DJANGO_PORT=8001

**Port 3000 already in use**

Solution: Kill existing React process: lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9, or set PORT=3001 in frontend/.env

**Database connection failed**

Solution: Ensure Docker is running: docker ps. Check PostgreSQL container: docker-compose logs postgres. Verify DATABASE_URL in .env matches docker-compose.yml

**Redis connection failed**

Solution: Check Redis container: docker-compose logs redis. Verify REDIS_URL in .env. Test connection: redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 ping

**Celery tasks not executing**

Solution: Ensure Celery worker is running: celery -A config worker -l info. Check Redis connection. Verify task is registered: celery -A config inspect registered

**Django migrations conflict**

Solution: Pull latest develop branch. Delete migration files causing conflict. Run: python manage.py makemigrations --merge. Resolve conflicts manually if needed.

**Frontend build fails with TypeScript errors**

Solution: Delete node_modules and package-lock.json. Run: npm install. Check TypeScript version matches package.json. Run: npm run type-check for detailed errors.

**AWS credentials not found**

Solution: Configure AWS CLI: aws configure. Or set environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in .env. For local development, use LocalStack for S3 simulation.

**CORS errors in browser console**

Solution: Verify CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in backend settings includes http://localhost:3000. Check django-cors-headers is installed and configured.

**Tests failing with database errors**

Solution: Use separate test database. Django creates test_<dbname> automatically. Ensure TEST database settings in config/settings/test.py. Run: pytest --create-db
