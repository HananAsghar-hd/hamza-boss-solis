# Developer Onboarding Guide

**Project:** Hamza Boss - Solis

*Generated by Foundation Agent*

## Welcome

Welcome to the Hamza Boss - Solis project. This platform integrates a React frontend with a Python FastAPI backend, deployed on AWS EKS with CI/CD via GitHub Actions. It supports project management, infrastructure provisioning, user authentication, and reporting.

### Key Contacts

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Tech Lead | Technical decisions, code reviews, architecture guidance |
| Project Manager | Sprint planning, stakeholder communication |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Installation |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Node.js | 18+ | `Download from nodejs.org or use package managers` |
| Docker | Latest | `Download from docker.com` |
| Git | Latest | `Download from git-scm.com` |

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository: git clone <repo-url>
2. Copy .env.example to .env and update environment variables
3. Build and run backend: cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Build and run frontend: cd frontend && npm install
5. Start local development: use docker-compose or respective start commands

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# clone
git clone <repo-url>

# install_backend
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# install_frontend
npm install (inside frontend directory)

# start_backend
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload

# start_frontend
npm run start (inside frontend directory)

# run_tests
pytest (for backend), npm test (for frontend)

```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Production-ready code |
| `develop` | Integration branch for ongoing development |
| `feature/*` | Feature branches off develop |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fix branches off develop |
| `hotfix/*` | Hotfixes directly on main |

### Commit Conventions

**Format:** `type(scope): message`

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add new endpoint
fix(auth): resolve login bug
docs(readme): update setup instructions
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create branch from develop
2. Make commits following conventions
3. Push branch and open PR against develop
4. Request review from team members
5. Address feedback and merge after approval

### Code Review Guidelines

- Review within 24 hours
- Check code quality, standards, and security
- Verify tests are included and passing
- Update documentation as needed

## Coding Standards

### Style Guide

Follow PEP8 for Python, ESLint + Prettier for JS

### Linting

Configured via ESLint and Flake8

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:** Mandatory for all new functions/classes
- **Integration Tests:** Cover API endpoints and critical workflows
- **Coverage Minimum:** 80%

### Documentation Requirements

- JSDoc for frontend functions
- Docstrings for Python functions
- Update README with new features
- API documentation for backend endpoints

## Architecture Overview

React frontend communicates with FastAPI backend via REST API, hosted on AWS EKS. Data stored in PostgreSQL, with Redis for caching. Infrastructure managed via Terraform and Kubernetes manifests.

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Frontend | React.js SPA with Material-UI |
| Backend | FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM |
| Database | PostgreSQL for primary data |
| Cache | Redis for caching |
| Infrastructure | AWS EKS, Terraform, Kubernetes |

### Important Patterns

- API-driven architecture
- Containerization with Docker
- IaC with Terraform

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts or container not starting**

Solution: Check Docker and Kubernetes logs, verify ports are free

**Database connection errors**

Solution: Ensure PostgreSQL and Redis containers/services are running, verify environment variables

### Getting Help

- Consult the documentation sections
- Ask questions in #dev channel on Slack or Teams
- Tag the Tech Lead for urgent issues
