## 5. ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURE

**5.1 Submission:** Provider will submit each Deliverable to Client via email to Hamza Farooq (hamza@horizondigital.au) with detailed description of deliverable, reference to applicable Acceptance Criteria, instructions for review and testing, and request for acceptance or feedback. For software deliverables, Provider will provide access to staging environment with demo credentials and user guide. For documentation deliverables, Provider will provide documents in PDF and/or editable format as appropriate. Provider will schedule demonstration or walkthrough session for major deliverables if requested by Client.

**5.2 Review Period:** Client shall have 5 Business Days from receipt of each Deliverable (the 'Review Period') to review, test, and evaluate the Deliverable against the specified Acceptance Criteria. Client may extend Review Period by up to 3 additional Business Days by providing written notice to Provider before expiration of initial Review Period, provided such extension is for legitimate business reasons and not used to unreasonably delay acceptance.

**5.3 Acceptance Criteria:** Each Deliverable will be deemed accepted if it meets all Acceptance Criteria specified in Schedule A (Statement of Work) for that Deliverable. Client will evaluate Deliverable against each Acceptance Criterion and confirm whether criterion is met, not met, or partially met. Acceptance occurs when: (a) Client provides written acceptance confirming Deliverable meets all Acceptance Criteria; or (b) Review Period expires without Client providing written rejection (deemed acceptance). Minor defects or cosmetic issues that do not materially impact functionality or prevent Deliverable from meeting Acceptance Criteria shall not be grounds for rejection.

**5.4 Rejection Procedure:** If Client determines that a Deliverable does not meet one or more Acceptance Criteria, Client must provide written rejection notice to Provider before expiration of Review Period. Rejection notice must: (a) specifically identify which Acceptance Criteria are not met; (b) provide detailed description of deficiencies with supporting evidence (screenshots, error messages, test results); (c) specify severity of each deficiency (critical, high, medium, low); and (d) be reasonable and made in good faith. Upon receipt of valid rejection notice, Provider shall have 5 Business Days to remediate critical and high-severity deficiencies and resubmit Deliverable for acceptance. Medium and low-severity deficiencies may be addressed in subsequent release or as part of warranty support. Client shall have 3 Business Days to review resubmitted Deliverable. This process may repeat until Deliverable meets Acceptance Criteria, provided both parties are acting in good faith.

**5.5 Deemed Acceptance:** If Client fails to provide either written acceptance or written rejection within the Review Period (including any approved extensions), the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted as of the expiration of the Review Period. Deemed acceptance has same effect as written acceptance for purposes of milestone completion, payment obligations, and warranty commencement. Provider will send reminder notice to Client 2 Business Days before Review Period expiration. Deemed acceptance does not apply if: (a) Deliverable was not actually delivered or made available to Client; (b) Client was unable to access or review Deliverable due to technical issues caused by Provider; or (c) Provider failed to provide necessary information, credentials, or documentation required for Client to evaluate Deliverable.

Change Requests must be submitted in writing via email to designated project contacts. Minor clarifications, bug fixes within existing functionality, and adjustments that do not materially alter Deliverables or timeline do not require formal Change Request.

**6.2 Impact Assessment:** Upon receipt of Change Request, Provider shall conduct impact assessment within 3 Business Days and provide written response including: (a) technical feasibility analysis; (b) estimated effort in hours/days; (c) impact on project timeline and milestones; (d) impact on project budget with cost estimate for additional work; (e) impact on existing functionality, architecture, and dependencies; (f) impact on testing, documentation, and training requirements; (g) recommended approach for implementation; and (h) risks and considerations. For complex changes requiring more than 3 days to assess, Provider will provide preliminary assessment within 3 Business Days and detailed assessment within 7 Business Days. Impact assessment is provided at no additional cost to Client.

**6.3 Approval Process:** Following impact assessment, Client shall review and decide whether to: (a) approve Change Request and proceed with implementation; (b) reject Change Request and maintain original scope; (c) defer Change Request to future phase; or (d) request modifications to proposed change. Client must provide decision in writing within 5 Business Days of receiving impact assessment. If Change Request requires additional budget beyond Total Contract Value or extends timeline by more than 2 weeks, both parties' authorized representatives must sign written Change Order amendment to this Agreement before implementation begins. Change Order shall specify: revised Scope of Work, revised timeline and milestones, additional costs and payment terms, and any other modified terms. Minor changes not materially affecting timeline or budget may be approved via email by Client's designated representative (Hamza Farooq). Provider will not begin work on approved Change Request until: (a) Change Order is fully executed (for material changes); or (b) written approval is received (for minor changes).

During the Warranty Period, Provider will, at no additional cost to Client, correct any defects, errors, or failures of the Work Product to materially conform to the specifications and Acceptance Criteria. 'Defect' means reproducible failure of Work Product to perform substantially in accordance with specifications, excluding issues caused by: (a) Client modifications to Work Product; (b) Client's failure to implement Provider's updates or patches; (c) use of Work Product in manner not contemplated by specifications; (d) third-party software or hardware failures; (e) Client's operating environment; or (f) Force Majeure events.

**9.3 Warranty Remedies:** Client's exclusive remedy for breach of warranty is Provider's obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct Defects during Warranty Period. Client must report Defects to Provider in writing with detailed description, steps to reproduce, and supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, error messages) within Warranty Period. Provider will acknowledge receipt within 1 Business Day and provide initial assessment within 3 Business Days. Provider will prioritize Defects as follows: (a) Critical (system down, data loss, security breach): response within 4 hours, resolution target 24 hours; (b) High (major feature not working, significant performance degradation): response within 1 Business Day, resolution target 5 Business Days; (c) Medium (minor feature issue, workaround available): response within 2 Business Days, resolution target 10 Business Days; (d) Low (cosmetic issue, minor inconvenience): response within 3 Business Days, resolution as time permits. If Provider is unable to correct material Defect within reasonable time after good faith efforts, Client may elect to: (i) accept Work Product with Defect and receive equitable reduction in price; or (ii) terminate this Agreement and receive refund of fees paid for non-conforming Deliverable, less reasonable value of any benefit received.

**9.4 Disclaimer:** EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8, PROVIDER MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. PROVIDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT WORK PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR MEET CLIENT'S SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS BEYOND SPECIFICATIONS IN SCHEDULE A. PROVIDER DOES NOT WARRANT PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY, OR AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS, AWS INFRASTRUCTURE, OR INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. PROVIDER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA LOSS, SECURITY BREACHES, OR OTHER ISSUES RESULTING FROM CLIENT'S FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES, BACKUP PROCEDURES, OR FOLLOW PROVIDER'S RECOMMENDATIONS. CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INVOLVES INHERENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND THAT PROVIDER CANNOT GUARANTEE SPECIFIC RESULTS OR OUTCOMES. CLIENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVALUATING WORK PRODUCT FOR CLIENT'S INTENDED USE AND FOR IMPLEMENTING APPROPRIATE TESTING, BACKUP, AND DISASTER RECOVERY PROCEDURES.
