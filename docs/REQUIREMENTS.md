- Access to existing systems for integration requirements (if applicable)
- Timely decision-making from client stakeholders
- Potential ClickUp API access for integration
- Client provision of test data and use cases
- Compliance documentation and requirements from client

## 8. Identified Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Undefined project scope may lead to scope creep and budget overruns | high | Conduct comprehensive requirements gathering sessions immediately; establish clear scope boundaries and change control process |
| Aerospace/defense industry regulations may impose unexpected compliance requirements | high | Identify all applicable regulations early; allocate budget contingency for compliance requirements |
| Limited budget ($50K) may not support full feature set expectations | high | Establish MVP scope early; prioritize features; plan phased delivery approach |
| Single point of contact may create communication bottlenecks | medium | Establish clear communication protocols; identify backup contacts; schedule regular check-ins |
| Lack of defined success criteria makes project acceptance ambiguous | high | Define clear, measurable success criteria and acceptance criteria before development begins |
| Unknown technical environment may require additional integration work | medium | Conduct technical discovery session to understand existing infrastructure and systems |
| Project health marked as GREEN despite lacking basic project information may indicate unrealistic expectations | medium | Reset expectations through comprehensive project kickoff; establish realistic timeline and milestones |
