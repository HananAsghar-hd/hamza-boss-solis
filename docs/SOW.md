**Project:** Hamza Boss - Solis
**Version:** 1.0

*Generated by Foundation Agent*

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the scope, deliverables, timeline, and responsibilities for the development and deployment of Solis, a custom web-based platform for Hamza Boss. This document serves as the formal agreement between Hamza Boss and the Service Provider regarding the project scope and expectations.

### 1.2 Background
Hamza Boss is a 45-person aerospace and defense organization seeking to improve operational efficiency through a centralized platform for project management, document control, resource allocation, and compliance tracking. The organization currently faces challenges with fragmented information across multiple tools, manual processes, and limited visibility into project and resource status. Solis will address these challenges through a purpose-built, cloud-based solution designed specifically for aerospace and defense workflows.

### 1.3 Objectives

- Deliver a secure, compliant web-based platform that centralizes project management, document management, and resource allocation
- Improve operational efficiency by reducing manual processes and providing real-time visibility into projects and resources
- Ensure compliance with aerospace and defense industry standards through comprehensive audit logging and security controls
- Provide scalable foundation that supports current operations (45 users) and future growth (up to 90 users)
- Complete MVP delivery within budget constraint of $50,000 AUD
- Enable user adoption through intuitive design and comprehensive documentation

## 2. Scope of Work

### 2.1 In Scope

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Requirements Analysis and Documentation | Comprehensive requirements gathering, analysis, and documentation including functional requirements, non-functional requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria |
| System Architecture and Design | Technical architecture design, database schema design, API design, security architecture, and UI/UX design for all MVP features |
| User Authentication and Authorization System | Secure login, password management, role-based access control (RBAC) with 5+ predefined roles, session management, and authentication audit logging |
| Project Management Dashboard | Project creation and configuration, task management, project status tracking, real-time dashboard with visual indicators, and project filtering/search capabilities |
| Document Management System | Secure document upload and storage, automatic version control, document search and filtering, access controls, and support for common file types (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, images) |
| Resource Allocation and Capacity Planning | Resource allocation tracking, capacity planning tools, over-allocation identification, and weekly/monthly allocation views |
| Reporting and Analytics | 10+ standard report templates, executive dashboard with KPIs, report export (PDF/Excel), scheduled report generation, and visual charts/graphs |
| Audit Logging and Compliance Tracking | Comprehensive activity logging, tamper-proof encrypted logs, searchable audit interface, compliance report generation, and 7-year log retention |
| Notification System | Email notifications for key events, in-app notification center, configurable user preferences, and 90-day notification history |
| User Profile Management | Self-service profile updates, password change functionality, profile photo upload, and notification preference configuration |
| Data Export and Backup | Data export in CSV and Excel formats, automated daily backups, encrypted backup storage, and 30/90-day backup retention |
| Cloud Infrastructure Setup | Cloud hosting configuration (AWS or Azure), database setup, security configuration, SSL/TLS setup, and monitoring configuration |
| Testing and Quality Assurance | Unit testing (80%+ code coverage), integration testing, security testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing support |
| Documentation | Technical documentation, API documentation, user guides, administrator guides, and deployment documentation |
| Training Materials | Video tutorials for key features, quick start guides, and FAQ documentation |
| Deployment and Go-Live Support | Production deployment, data migration support (if applicable), go-live monitoring, and immediate post-launch support (2 weeks) |

### 2.2 Out of Scope

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Specialized Aerospace/Defense Certifications | ITAR, EAR, or other specialized certifications are not included in MVP scope due to budget constraints. Can be addressed in future phases if required. |
| ClickUp Integration | Third-party integrations are planned for Phase 2 to focus MVP budget on core functionality |
| Native Mobile Applications | MVP includes responsive web design for mobile browsers; native iOS/Android apps are future phase features |
| 24/7 Support and Monitoring | MVP includes business hours support only (9 AM - 5 PM AEST, Monday-Friday). 24/7 support can be added post-launch if required. |
| On-Premise Deployment | Solution is cloud-based only for cost-effectiveness. On-premise deployment would require significant additional investment. |
| Custom Hardware Integration | No specialized hardware or equipment integration is included in scope |
| Advanced AI/ML Features | Predictive analytics and machine learning features are planned for future phases |
| Multi-Language Support | MVP supports English only. Additional languages can be added in future phases. |
| End-User Training Delivery | Provider will deliver training materials and documentation; client is responsible for conducting end-user training sessions |
| Ongoing Maintenance and Support Beyond 2 Weeks Post-Launch | Post-launch support beyond initial 2-week period requires separate maintenance agreement |

### 2.3 Assumptions
