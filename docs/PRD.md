## Problem Statement

### Current State
Hamza Boss currently faces challenges typical of growing aerospace and defense organizations: fragmented project information across multiple tools, manual document management processes, limited visibility into resource allocation, time-consuming manual reporting, and difficulty maintaining compliance audit trails. The organization likely uses a combination of spreadsheets, email, and possibly ClickUp for project management, but lacks an integrated solution tailored to aerospace and defense workflows. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, increased risk of errors, difficulty in compliance reporting, and challenges in scaling operations as the company grows.

### Desired State
Hamza Boss envisions a unified platform where all project information, documents, and resources are managed in one secure, compliant system. Project managers should have real-time visibility into project health, resource allocation, and potential bottlenecks. Engineers should have clear task assignments and easy access to relevant documentation. Executives should have high-level dashboards showing organizational performance and KPIs. Compliance officers should be able to generate audit reports on demand. The system should automate routine tasks, enforce security and compliance requirements, and scale seamlessly as the organization grows.

### Gap Analysis
The primary gaps include: (1) Lack of centralized project management tailored to aerospace and defense workflows, (2) No secure document repository with version control and compliance tracking, (3) Limited visibility into resource allocation and capacity, (4) Manual, time-consuming reporting processes, (5) Inadequate audit logging for compliance requirements, (6) No integration between existing tools creating data silos, (7) Difficulty scaling current processes to support organizational growth. Solis addresses these gaps through purpose-built features while remaining within budget constraints through phased delivery and cloud-based architecture.

## Product Vision

Solis will become the operational backbone of Hamza Boss, providing a secure, compliant, and efficient platform that enables the organization to deliver aerospace and defense projects with excellence while scaling confidently to meet future growth. Within 12 months of deployment, Solis will be the primary system for project execution, document management, and operational reporting, trusted by all 45 employees and positioned to support the organization's growth to 90+ employees.
